# Breast Cancer prediction

This is a training project on the famous Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data). 
There is also a detailed analysis of this Dataset on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/projects/breast-cancer-prediction-using-machine-learning#details) 
and in general, this project follows this analysis.  

But a better result was obtained here: Using fewer predictors we achieved the same accuracy.
we chose which variables will be dropped based only on the Exploratory Data Analysis. It's a good result because 
it means reducing time and other costs.
